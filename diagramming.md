# Diagramming Conventions in ERD

## Tables

## Columns

### Rows - never shown

Just a note on rows: ERDs show the _schema_ of the database, not its actual _content_. As such, we never diagram individual rows.

## Primary Key

## One to one relation

> Be specific: the line should align with the actual PK and FK on the diagram

## One to many relation

## Many to many - link table
