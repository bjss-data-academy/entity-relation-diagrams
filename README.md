# Entity Relation Diagrams

Data Engineering, rather unsurprisingly, heavily features _data_, and wherever there is data, relational data is never far away.

This quick guide describes the conventions used for Entity Relation Diagrams. These are the industry-standard way of describing relational data structures.

We will gain practical experience using the excellent online ERD tool dbdiagram.

## Prerequisites

Knowledge of SQL basics: table, row, column, primary key, relations.

See our guide at [SQL Fundamentals](https://github.com/bjssacademy/fundamentals-sql) for more details and a refresher.
